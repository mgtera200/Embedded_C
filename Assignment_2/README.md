# Assignment: Embedded C UART Application

## Description:
This is my solution for an assignment focusing on creating a simple UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) application using Embedded C. The assignment includes:

- startup.s: Assembly startup file for initializing the microcontroller.
- linkerscript.ld: Linker script defining memory layout and sections for the project.
- uart_application.c: C file containing the implementation of the UART application.
- symbols.txt: Text file listing symbols used in the project for reference.
- uart_application.map: Map file generated after linking, providing insights into memory usage and symbol locations.


This assignment helped me gain practical experience in embedded systems programming and understanding the UART communication protocol.
